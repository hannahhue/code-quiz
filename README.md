## Description

This webpage is used to test our coding knowledge, although short and sweet can be super effective. My motivation for this challenge was to input my understanding of functions and implement it not only in the scxript but to then call and connect it into the HTML as well. It solves local storage usage and basic calling from different functions into another. It also gives your brain a nice sense of accomplishment once completed. I learned that connecting the JS into the HTML to get it to show what i want when i want was more challenging than I expected. Although i struggled (and restared) a lot durring this project, im still proud of my product even though it has flaws. I hope to return to this project one day and expand on it and make it more functional.
